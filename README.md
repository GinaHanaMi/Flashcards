Flashcards is a tool to help learning languages by training using flashcards.
The app was made for PL-EN trainings, but this will change soon.

You can add your own words to memorize, import them from .txt file, create new sets of words. It comes with built in translator, voice recognition (for EN). There is also a feture to play the proper pronunciation of the word.
